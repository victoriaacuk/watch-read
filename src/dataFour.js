        description:"The action of the cycle takes place in a fictional world. The main events take place on the mainland of Westeros , which with its economy, culture and social structure resembles Europe during the High Middle Ages , and partly on the more eastern continent called Essos, which is distinguished by ethnic and geographical diversity. The highest nobility of Westeros is called the Great Houses. Approximately three hundred years before the events of the Game of Thrones, the Targaryen dynasty , using three dragons , conquered all the lands of Westeros from the Wall to the southern shores of Dorne and created a single empire. The Targaryen family comes from ancient Valyria. Aegon I married his sisters, and this tradition was often observed in their family. The dynasty began to fade with the death of the last dragons. The madness of Aerys II gave rise to a rebellion, as a result of which the dynasty was destroyed.",
